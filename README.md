# Program-that-adds-a-text-function-to-a-file
This program adds a text feature to the already existing file

This program is specifically created to perform text operations in a file. Hence the AppendText() function that is being is used to create a StreamWriter. It is used to append UTF-8 encoded text to an existing file or to a new file if the specified file does not exist.

Then the specified CreateText() function is used to create or open a file for writing UTF-8 encoded text. From there, the OpenText() function is used to open an existing UTF-8 encoded text file for reading. Here appending text, and/or  creating new text operations are performed and will then print the file text operations.
